This repo is a place for me to store source code that I am writing as I
endeavour to refresh my knowledge of programming languages. Feel free to use,
modify, or copy any code or algorithm that you find here. As this is also the
first git repo that I have ever created, I will be finding my way through how to
use git for something more than git cloning to grab source to build locally.

TODO:
Implement more advanced functions, square/square root, etc.
Further refine UI.
Find way to use operator keys to single end of input.
